##Reegle Library for Android##

This is an open source project intended to make access of Reegle's [recommended document service](http://api.reegle.info/documentation/) convenient on Android devices.

[Reegle](http://www.reegle.info/) is a Linked Open Data framework for environmental policy related content. From their website: "The reegle tagging API is a cost-free tagging tool for those publishing resources in the clean energy and climate area. It can also be used to deepen content by suggesting related resources from the indexed content pool." They also offer services to tag new content to enable users to find that content through relevant searches.

If you are interested in this project or any others related to organization of environmental content and data, your feedback is welcome.

*Note:* Before generating an apk from source, you must go to src/models/Search.java and enter a valid [Reegle API token](http://api.reegle.info/register).
